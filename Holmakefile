# Root Holmakefile - builds all theories including test infrastructure
# TODO: venom/analysis and venom/passes both back-reference venom/ for shared
# defs (venomInst, venomState, etc.), preventing venom/ from including them.
# Refactor shared defs into venom/shared/ so venom/{analysis,passes} can
# include venom/shared/ without cycles, and root only needs top-level dirs.

# LEARNINGS_type_system_rewrite

Reusable proof patterns only. Greppable structured entries; evidence refs point to episodes/tool outputs/source.

## L0001 scope='C1.1' tags=ExtCall,Resume,boundary_lemma,holbuild-timeout,monadic-continuation
shape: ExtCall Resume proof after `Once evaluate_def` exposes full `case INL vs of ... do ...` continuation and generated IHs
pattern: Do not prove ExtCall directly inside the suspended mutual Resume. First add standalone local boundaries: one wrapper from record-updated state to `extcall_return_tail_sound`, then an `extcall_expr_sound_from_generated_ih` helper. The final Resume should only select the args/driver IHs and apply the helper.
works_when: Applies to `eval_all_type_sound_mutual[Expr_Call_ExtCall]` and similar call-target branches where holbuild timeouts occur on broad simplification of a monadic evaluator continuation.

## L0002 scope='C1.1.1' tags=runtime_consistent,record-update,extcall_return_tail_sound,update_accounts_transient
shape: Need ExtCall result after `base_st with <| accounts := accounts'; tStorage := tStorage' |>`
pattern: Bridge the post-run external-call state by deriving `runtime_consistent env cx (base_st with <| accounts := accounts'; tStorage := tStorage' |>)` from `runtime_consistent env cx base_st` and `accounts_well_typed accounts'` via `update_accounts_transient_runtime_consistent`, then apply `extcall_return_tail_sound` unchanged to the supplied return-tail equation.
works_when: The return data path is already isolated as `(if returnData=[] /\ IS_SOME drv then eval_expr cx (THE drv) else do ... od) updated_st = (res,st')` and the caller has driver typing/IH premises.

## L0003 scope='C1.1' tags=ExtCall,annotation,expr_result_typed,well_typed_expr_def
shape: ExtCall soundness helper conclusion mentions `expr_result_typed env (Call ?ty (ExtCall stat (func_name,arg_types,ret_type)) es drv) tv`.
pattern: Use the external signature return type as the `Call` annotation (`Call ret_type ...`). If a helper keeps an arbitrary annotation variable, applying tail/result-typing lemmas will demand `ret_type = loc` and type evaluation at `loc`. Extract/normalize the annotation equality from `well_typed_expr_def` before invoking helpers.
works_when: Applies to ExtCall statement/expression soundness helpers whose target is `ExtCall _ (_,arg_types,ret_type)` and whose result typing is delegated to `extcall_return_tail_sound` or `extcall_after_state_update_tail_sound`.

## L0004 scope='C1.1.2' tags=ExtCall,Resume,generated-IH,FAIL_TAC,helper-boundary
shape: Suspended ExtCall Resume has generated args IH plus guarded driver IH and a >4KiB evaluator-success implication.
pattern: Probe the Resume only to identify generated IH shapes, then restore the cheat and prove a standalone helper. The helper should consume the args IH (`eval_exprs cx es`) and a driver IH for `THE drv`; the Resume should later only select/name those IHs and apply the helper.
works_when: Use when a suspended mutual-theorem branch has a large evaluator continuation but the needed IHs are visible at the top-level Resume goal.

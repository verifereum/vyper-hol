(*
 * The cross-block DFG alias invariant of the block induction behind
 * venomToAsmProps$gen_fn_frame_simulation.
 *
 * gen_fn_frame_simulation assumes that every operand on the planner's
 * stack or in its spill map has the value of its ASSIGN-chain root
 * (normalize_operand), read through the frame view.  The planner's
 * alias-only reorder steps rely on it.  The induction must re-establish
 * it at the successor block, whose lineage state carries the stack and
 * spill map the current block's code leaves (fnPlanLineage).
 *
 * TOP-LEVEL:
 *   lineage_alias_successor — CHEATED: one block preserves the invariant

(* Used at each jump of the block induction, for the successor's alias
   premise.  The invariant reads only ps_stack and ps_spilled, so the
   lineage entry state of the successor (its DFS state with ps_after's
   stack and spill map, lineage_entry) inherits it from ps_after.  The
   block's code is the one lineage_state_block_plan regenerates from the
   lineage state ps, with the cleanup fields it chooses.

   The ownership premise is the planner's static entry invariant: every
   variable live into the block along the edge taken is on the stack or
   spilled.  Without it a block could copy (ASSIGN) a variable the planner
   doesn't hold, whose value need not be its root's after a loop
   iteration, and push the copy.

   Why it should hold: a variable defined in the block by ASSIGN of an
   owned operand takes that operand's value, which is its root's; any
   other definition is its own root.  A root's value only changes when
   its definition runs again, and by SSA and def_dominates_uses a
   variable derived from it is then no longer live, so the planner has
   dropped it: popped, overwritten by a PHI poke, or left behind at the
   join reorder of a JMP (every loop header is a join).  An INVOKE
   changes only its own outputs among the caller's variables.  Return-PC
   variables all read ra in the frame view, and so do their roots. *)

(* Notes from a statement check (intuition, not a prescribed proof):
   - Where the planner drops names (stackPlanGen): an operand dead after
     its instruction is consumed rather than duplicated; dead outputs are
     popped at the end of generate_regular_inst_plan when the block does
     not halt (PHI outputs likewise); after a JNZ clean_stack_plan pops
     dead names or marks them dead_stack_marker; release_dead_spills
     drops dead spills after each regular instruction.  reorder_one's
     alias step only swaps the names of two slots.  So a name in ps_after
     is a name of ps (stack or spill map) or an output of bb.
   - A name z live out of bb, not defined in bb, whose root is defined in
     bb, is impossible: bb dominates z's definition (def_dominates_uses,
     transitively along the ASSIGN chain), and an entry path that meets
     bb only at its end, followed by liveness_sound's witness path, misses
     z's definition.  A bb entered around a loop is a join (entry block
     has no predecessors), entered only by JMP (block_entries_ready),
     whose reorder leaves only names live into it.
   - The ps premises tie ps to vs only through ownership and the alias
     premise; ps's names beyond those are bounded by a static invariant
     of lineage states (their names are live out of the lineage
     predecessor, and the vars live along that edge are all held), which
     also covers a run with vs_prev_bb = NONE at a non-entry block.  The
     entry block has no live-in variables.
   - dead_stack_marker is Label "", and Lit/Label operands are fixed by
     normalize_operand, so only Var operands matter.  PHI and INVOKE
     outputs are their own roots.  For return-PC variables, copy_phi_var
     and retpc_shape_ok keep every link of the chain a return-PC
     variable, so both sides read ra. *)

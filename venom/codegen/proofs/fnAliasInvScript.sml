 * gen_fn_frame_simulation assumes that every operand on the planner's
 * stack or in its spill map has the value of its ASSIGN-chain root
 * (normalize_operand), read through the frame view.  The planner's
 * alias-only reorder steps rely on it.  The induction must re-establish
 * it at the successor block, whose lineage state carries the stack and
 * spill map the current block's code leaves (fnPlanLineage).

(* Used at each jump of the block induction, for the successor's alias
   premise.  The invariant reads only ps_stack and ps_spilled, so the
   lineage entry state of the successor (its DFS state with ps_after's
   stack and spill map, lineage_entry) inherits it from ps_after.  The
   block's code is the one lineage_state_block_plan regenerates from the
   lineage state ps, with the cleanup fields it chooses.

   The ownership premise is the planner's static entry invariant: every
   variable live into the block along the edge taken is on the stack or
   spilled.  Without it a block could copy (ASSIGN) a variable the planner
   doesn't hold, whose value need not be its root's after a loop
   iteration, and push the copy.

   Why it should hold: a variable defined in the block by ASSIGN of an
   owned operand takes that operand's value, which is its root's; any
   other definition is its own root.  A root's value only changes when
   its definition runs again, and by SSA and def_dominates_uses a
   variable derived from it is then no longer live, so the planner has
   dropped it: popped, overwritten by a PHI poke, or left behind at the
   join reorder of a JMP (every loop header is a join).  An INVOKE
   changes only its own outputs among the caller's variables.  Return-PC
   variables all read ra in the frame view, and so do their roots. *)

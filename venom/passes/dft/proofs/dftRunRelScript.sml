(*
 * Runs of a context and of its DFT schedule, with the same fuel.
 *
 * C' is C with every function rescheduled as dftScheduleOrder describes
 * (dft_fn_rel).  A run of a function of C and the run of its schedule in
 * C', from the function's entry block and with the same fuel, end alike
 * (dft_res_rel): the same continuing, returning or halting state, an
 * abort for an abort, and a revert for a revert.  When the run of C
 * errors, the run of C' does not continue or return either.
 *
 * Why the abort state may differ: the schedule can run instructions with
 * independent effects in another order before an instruction that stops
 * the run (an INVOKE whose callee aborts, a failing ASSERT).  It keeps the
 * fallible instructions in order (dft_fallible_order_kept), so the first
 * one to stop the run is the same on both sides; what can run early is an
 * instruction that cannot stop the run.  ctx_labels_bound keeps one with
 * a label operand (OFFSET) from erroring there.
